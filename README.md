===========

Set of tools of manipulating and editing files from the Super Street Fighter 4 series of games from Capcom

SFUltraDiff
==================

This tool takes Super, AE, and 2012 movesets from a SF4 PC Install and creates automated changelists for each character for each version. The results are posted at http://watissf.dantarion.com/sfultradiff/ so if thats all you wanna see, thats where they are. However, the code that generates the above site is included here!

Dantarion coded this to have it done in time for when Ultra SF4 comes out!
