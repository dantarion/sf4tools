I have decided to move my datadumps to github where possible.

Part of doing this kind of thing involves putting hours and hours into create a resource for a community of people I may not even directly interact with.
I want to ensure that when I am gone, working on other projects, or, when I bite the bullet for good, that my work is not only up for people to see, but for others to study and improve upon!

Setting this up on Github ensures that even after my hosting account dies, the code driving this site will live on for others to archive.
